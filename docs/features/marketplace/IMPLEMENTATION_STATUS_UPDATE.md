  - `approveProvider()` - Approve provider and create Service documents
  - `rejectProvider()` - Reject provider with reason
  - `getVerificationStats()` - Admin dashboard statistics
  - `createTestProvider()` - Testing utility

- ✅ **Admin Routes** (`backend/src/routes/admin.routes.ts`)
  - `GET /api/admin/providers/pending` - Pending providers list
  - `GET /api/admin/providers/:id` - Provider details for verification
  - `POST /api/admin/providers/:id/approve` - Approve provider
  - `POST /api/admin/providers/:id/reject` - Reject provider
  - `GET /api/admin/providers/stats` - Verification statistics
  - `POST /api/admin/test/create-provider` - Create test provider

#### **Frontend Implementation:**

#### **Key Innovation - Service Auto-Creation:**

#### **Files Modified:**

- `backend/src/middleware/validation.middleware.ts` - Added type conversion support
- `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts` - Updated validation middleware usage

### **🔄 PROVIDER TO SERVICE SYNC SYSTEM** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Goal**: Sync existing approved provider services to searchable Service documents

#### **Scripts Created:**
- ✅ **Service Sync Script** (`backend/scripts/syncProviderServices.js`)
  - Finds all approved providers with services
  - Creates corresponding Service documents for searchability
  - Handles duplicate prevention
